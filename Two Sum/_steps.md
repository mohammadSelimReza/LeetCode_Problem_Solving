1.
Two sums can be calculate by doing loop * loop
But thats not optimal.
as it takes N*N time to complete but it saves space thats only O(1)

2.
Efficient but takes space.
Its Hash Table 

3.
Two pointer Technique
using quick sort then  compare left and right to choose the target.
While its better than first approch as its low time complexity
but it still take more time than process 2.
(but we can get index)
